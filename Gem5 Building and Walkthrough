A Detailed Walkthrough of the Environment Setup, Build Process, and Running a Simulation
Setting up gem5 started with enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on my Windows machine. This step was essential because gem5 requires a Linux environment to build and run. Once WSL was installed, I moved on to installing the necessary dependencies. I used the following commands to update my package list and install tools like Python, GCC, and SCons:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip gcc g++ scons zlib1g-dev
After installing the dependencies, I cloned the gem5 repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/gem5/gem5.git
cd gem5
Building gem5 turned out to be more challenging than I expected. Initially, I ran the build command:
scons build/X86/gem5.opt
However, this process consumed a lot of memory and kept failing with an error saying collect2: fatal error: ld terminated with signal 9. It took me some time to figure out that my system needed more memory to complete the build. To solve this, I created a swap file to increase virtual memory, using these commands:
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
After adding the swap memory, I restarted the build process using a lighter and faster target:
scons -j1 build/X86/gem5.fast
Once the build was complete, I ran a basic Hello World simulation to verify that gem5 was working correctly:
build/X86/gem5.fast configs/deprecated/example/se.py -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/x86/linux/hello
The simulation output confirmed that everything was set up correctly:
Hello world!
